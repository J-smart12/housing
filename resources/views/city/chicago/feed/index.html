										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Flawlessly executed, an estate of ultimate exclusivity on nearly an acre of privately-gated land, this trophy property was built by architect William Beckett to capture an architectural escape while boasting the most luxurious of amenities and sited in prime Beverly Hills. Fully reimagined in 2015, large walls of glass bathing the open rooms in natural light, a quintessential wooden curved wall gives a nod to the midcentury architecture and matches the curvature of the exterior grand entrance, and a state-of-the-art chefs kitchen with Miele appliances create a home of functionality and sophistication.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behind a cheery, red door in this handsome line of brick row houses lies a special Portland home! This is the only condo in the association that boasts a private entrance from Park Street &amp; has direct access from the back courtyard. Gracious in style and size, this unit was renovated to the studs with timeless updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The oversized living room features high ceilings, a wall of built-ins, and a charming fireplace surround. Custom cabinetry in the mudroom hides a clever work station. The kitchen is bright &amp; efficient, with a Viking gas range &amp; floor-to-ceiling storage. There&#8217;s plenty of space for dining, or continue out the back door for patio access &amp; a grill! Marble-tiled floor &amp; shower and a custom vanity in the bath make a modern statement. Enjoy the convenience of a reserved parking space, in-unit W/D &amp; additional storage in the basement. Steps to all of Portland&#8217;s favorite dining &amp; entertainment locales!</p>

<p>If, then—for there were “ifs” still—the sea did not become too boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December. It is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire.</p>
<p>During the first days, they went along smoothly enough. The sea was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.</p>
